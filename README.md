# Lightstreamer JMS Extender - Basic Stock-List Demo - HTML Client

<!-- START DESCRIPTION lightstreamer-jms-example-stocklist-client-javascript -->

This project includes a front-end example based on the Basic Stock-List Demo for Lightstreamer JMS Extender.

## Details

This demo displays real-time market data for 20 stocks, generated by the feed simulator included in the [Stock-List Demo Java Service](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java). For simplicity, a single JMS topic is used for all stocks, while in a production environment you would probably use a different JMS topic for each stock.

This page uses the <b>Lightstreamer JMS Extender JavaScript Client API</b> to handle the communications with JMS Extender.

Check out the sources for further explanations.

## Install

Before you can run the demo of this project, some dependencies need to be solved:

* Note that, as prerequisite, the [Lightstreamer JMS Extender - Stock-List Demo - Java (JMS) Service](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java) has to be deployed on your local Lightstreamer JMS Extender instance. Please check out that project and follow the installation instructions provided with it.
* Launch Lightstreamer JMS Extender.
* Get the `lightstreamer-jms.js` file from the [Lightstreamer JMS Extender](http://download.lightstreamer.com/#jms) and put it in the root folder of this project.
* [Lightstreamer visual widgets](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-lib-client-widgets-javascript), such as the status widget and dynagrid, are hot-linked in the html page: they are in no way mandatory and you may replace them with widgets from any other library by modifying `grid.js` and the `onLSClient` event in `index.html`.
* RequireJS is currently hot-linked in the html page: you may want to replace it with a local version and/or to upgrade its version.

Now, you need to configure the `index.html` of this example by specifying the name of the JMS connector you are going to use. By default, the demo will look for the <b>HornetQ</b> JMS connector, please refer to the related [Service project](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java) for more details on the choice of a JMS broker to be used.
To set the JMS connector name and the connection name, look where the connection is created:

```js
  TopicConnectionFactory.createTopicConnection("http://localhost:8080/", "HornetQ", null, null, {
```

To access the demo from a web browser, copy it somewhere under your root webserver directory. You can also add it to the JMS Extender internal web server pages under `JMSExtenderHome/pages` directory by copying it there with a folder name such as `StockListDemo_JMS`. Subsequently you may access it as: <i>http://_your_jms_extender_http_address_/StockListDemo_JMS/</i>.
Depending on the browser in use, and on the security settings, you might also be able to launch the index.html file directly from the file system.
